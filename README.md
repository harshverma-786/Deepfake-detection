# Deepfake Detection Using CNN + Grad-CAM

This project implements a deep learning–based approach to detect AI-manipulated (deepfake) images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) combined with Grad-CAM for visual explainability. The system classifies images as real or forged and highlights manipulated regions to improve transparency and reliability.
